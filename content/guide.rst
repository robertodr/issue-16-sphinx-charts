   The evolution of microprocessors. The number of transistors per chip
   increases every 2 years or so. However, it can no longer be exploited by the
   core frequency due to power consumption limits. Before 2000, the increase in
   the single core clock frequency was the major source of performance increase.
   Mid-2000 mark a transition towards multi-core processors.
